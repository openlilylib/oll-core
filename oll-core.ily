% This is the main entry file for openLilyLib.
% To use openLilyLib this file has to be in LilyPond's include path.
% including this file with
%     \include "openlilylib.ily"
% will initialize openLilyLib and make the library management available
% as well as significant utility functionality.
%
% This does several things:
% - defines a global variable 'openlilylib-root
%   which is the absolute path to the root of openLilyLib
%   (the parent of the folder this file is located in)
% - adds openlilylib-root to Scheme's module path
% - adds library/module handling support
% - adds option handling
% - adds logging tools
% - adds miscellaneous helper functionality (e.g. version predicates)

% We won't support 2.18 anymore as there are simply too many
% substantial improvements in the 2.19 branch.
% While development versions are usually more or less up to date,
% 2.19.22 marks an important step regarding access to LilyPond's parser.
