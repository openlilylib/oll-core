% Include not only a single file but all files in a directory
% that match a given pattern.
% #1: <in-dir>
%     A string indicating the parent directory from which to include
%     If it is an absolute path this is taken literally,
%     a relative path is interpreted relative to the file
%     in which \includePattern is used.
%     If the parent directory does not exist a simple warning is issued
% #2: <pattern>
%     A regex pattern to match files in <in-dir>
%     Files are included in alphabetical order.
%     NOTE: files included later do *not* have access to definitions
%     from earlier files in the same invocation of \includePattern.
