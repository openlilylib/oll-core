% Helper functions handling the low-level differences between OSes
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Path operations
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The core of OS-independent path handling:
% force an arbitrary path to be a list of strings.
% From there we can reconstruct paths in arbitrary ways.

%#(define os-path-split os-path-split)
%#(define os-path-split-os os-path-split-os)

% Output paths in different forms
% First force the input to be a list, then convert it to the desired format
% All the functions take a 'path' argument as processed by os-path-split.

#(define os-path-join-os os-path-join-os)
#(define os-path-join os-path-join)
#(define os-path-join-dots os-path-join-dots)


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Path manipulations
%
% The following functions all take a path argument
% that can be passed to os-path-split, i.e. a
% OS-specific string or list of strings or symbols.
% They always return the resulting path as a list of strings

% Handling absolute and relative paths

#(define os-path-absolute? os-path-absolute?)
#(define os-path-absolute os-path-absolute)
#(define os-path-normalize os-path-normalize)
#(define os-path-cwd-list os-path-cwd-list)
#(define os-path-dirname os-path-dirname)

% processing "location" arguments
%#(define location->normalized-path location->normalized-path)
%#(define location-extract-path location-extract-path)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% "this" functions
%
% These functions operate on the file where they are used
% (i.e. *not* necessarily the file that is currently being compiled)

#(define this-file this-file)
#(define this-dir this-dir)
#(define this-parent this-parent)
#(define this-file-compiled? this-file-compiled?)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Directory operations
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Return all files from the given dir
% as a string list
#(define scandir scandir)
% Return all subdirectories from the given dir
% as a string list
#(define get-subdirectories get-subdirectories)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input file operations
%
% Retrieve information and produce variants of the input file name
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Returns a list with the absolute path to the compiled input file
#(define os-path-input-file os-path-input-file)
% Returns a string with the absolute path to the compiled input file
#(define os-path-input-filename os-path-input-filename)
% Returns a list with the absolute path of the directory containing the input file
#(define os-path-input-dir os-path-input-dir)
% Returns a string with the absolute path of the directory containing the input file
#(define os-path-input-dirname os-path-input-dirname)
% Returns a string wtih the absolute path to the input file, without file extension
#(define os-path-input-basename os-path-input-basename)
